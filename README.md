# Utilizing whole-cell biosensors to measure ionic mercury in water sample

The presente repository contains a Jupyter notebook template for analyzing optical density and fluorescence data obtained from a microplate reader to characterize the dose-response curve of mercury biosensors (Mer-RFP) based on the Biosynthesis Flux Allocation Model proposed by Nicolás A. Vaccari, Dahlin Zevallos-Aliaga, Tom Peeters and Daniel G. Guerra (see publication [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.01.569588v2)].

# Framework
